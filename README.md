# Rowing software

Here I am developing a rowing simulator.
There will be a number of versions.

Gazabo is used as the simulator and the control is done via ROS.

### boot0, the pusher.



### boot1, the basic skull boat.




### boot2

With basic infrastructure for controlling the experiment


### boot3

Rower added
